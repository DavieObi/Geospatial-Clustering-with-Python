# Contributing to Geospatial-Clustering-with-Python

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the **Geospatial-Clustering-with-Python** project!  
This open-source repository focuses on analysing geospatial datasets, applying unsupervised clustering techniques (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN, hierarchical clustering) on latitude-longitude and other spatial features to uncover meaningful location-based clusters. Every contribution — whether small or large — is warmly welcomed.

## 🏆 How You Can Contribute

- **Data & Feature Enhancements**: Provide additional geospatial datasets (points, routes, regions), refine preprocessing (coordinate transformations, handling GPS errors, merging ancillary spatial features).  
- **Clustering & Analysis Improvements**: Experiment with new clustering algorithms (e.g., HDBSCAN, OPTICS), tune parameters, validate clusters (silhouette, Davies-Bouldin), interpret spatial segments.  
- **Visualization & Dashboards**: Add map-based visualisations (folium, geopandas, plotly), interactive dashboards showing clusters overlaid on maps, cluster centroids, segment insights.  
- **Documentation & Tutorials**: Improve the README, write step-by-step guides, include notebook walkthroughs, explain spatial clustering logic for newcomers.  
- **Bug Fixes & Code Optimisation**: Fix issues in notebooks or scripts, enhance code readability, ensure reproducibility, optimise performance for large spatial datasets.
